# enrol_signup
This Moodle enrolment plugin lets you enrol users in the desired courses when they sign up to Moodle.

For example, you can set it to enrol all your new users to the "Moodle intro" course.

You just need to enable the plugin in the courses you want users to be auto-enroled when they register.
